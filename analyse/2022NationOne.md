Goffin’s cockatoos, a kind of small parrot native to Australasia, have been shown to have similar shape-recognition abilities to a human two-year-old. **Though not known to use tools in the wild, the birds have proved skilful at tool use while kept in the cage.** In a recent experiment, cockatoos were presented with a box with a nut inside it. The clear front of the box had a “keyhole” in a geometric shape, and the birds were given five differently shaped “keys” to choose from. Inserting the correct “key” would let out the nut.

**In humans, babies can put a round shape in a round hole from around one year of age**, but it will be another year before they are able to do the same with less symmetrical (对称的) shapes. This ability to recognize that a shape will need to be turned in a specific direction before it will fit is called an “allocentric frame of reference”. In the experiment, Goffin’s cockatoos were able to select the right tool for the job, in most cases, by visual recognition alone. Where trial-and-error was used, the cockatoos did better than monkeys in similar tests. This indicates that Goffin’s cockatoos do indeed possess an allocentric frame of reference when moving objects in space, similar to two-year-old babies.

The next step, according to the researchers, is to try and work out whether the cockatoos rely entirely on visual clues (线索), or also use a sense of touch in making their shape selections.

How did the cockatoos get the nut from the box in the experiment?

    B

A. By following instructions.  
B. By using a tool.

D. Grouping toys of different shapes.

    D

A. How far they are able to see.  
B. How they track moving objects.  
C. Whether they are smarter than monkeys.  
D. Whether they use a sense of touch in the test.

Which can be a suitable title for the text?

    D

As Ginni Bazlinton reached Antarctica, she found herself greeted by a group of little Gentoo penguins (企鹅) longing to say hello. These gentle, lovely gatekeepers welcomed her and kick-started what was to be a trip Ginni would never forget.

Ever since her childhood, Ginni, now 71, has had a deep love for travel. Throughout her career (职业) as a professional dancer, she toured in the UK, but always longed to explore further. When she retired from dancing and her sons eventually flew the nest, she decided it was time to take the plunge.

After taking a degree at Chichester University in Related Arts, Ginni began to travel the world, eventually getting work teaching English in Japan and Chile. **And it was in Chile she discovered she could get last-minute cheap deals on ships going to Antarctica from the islands off Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of the South American mainland.** “I just decided I wanted to go,” she says. “I had no idea about what I’d find there and I wasn’t nervous, I just wanted to do it. And I wanted to do it alone as I always prefer it that way.”

In March 2008, Ginni boarded a ship with 48 passengers she’d never met before, to begin the journey towards Antarctica. “From seeing the wildlife to witnessing sunrises, the whole experience was amazing. **Antarctica left an impression on me that no other place has**,” Ginni says. “I remember the first time I saw a humpback whale; it just rose out of the water like some prehistoric creature and I thought it was smiling at us. You could still hear the operatic sounds it was making underwater.”

The realization that this is a precious land, to be respected by humans, was one of the biggest things that hit home to Ginni.

What made Ginni decide on the trip to Antarctica?

B. Beautiful scenery.

What does Ginni think about Antarctica after the journey?

    C

A. It could be a home for her.  
B. It should be easily accessible.  
C. It should be well preserved.  
D. It needs to be fully introduced.

What is the text mainly about?

    B

A. A childhood dream.  
B. An unforgettable experience.  
C. Sailing around the world.  
D. Meeting animals in Antarctica.

Sometime in the early 1960s, a significant thing happened in Sydney, Australia. The city discovered its harbor. Then, one after another, Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there — broad parks, superb beaches, and a culturally diverse population. But it is the harbor that makes the city.

Andrew Reynolds, a cheerful fellow in his early 30s, pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living. I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor. After our third run Andrew shut down the engine, and we went our separate ways — he for a lunch break, I to explore the city.

**“I’ll miss these old boats,” he said as we parted.**

“How do you mean?” I asked.

“Oh, they’re replacing them with catamarans. Catamarans are faster, but they’re not so elegant, and they’re not fun to pilot. But that’s progress, I guess.”

Everywhere in Sydney these days, change and progress are the watchwords (口号), and traditions are increasingly rare. Shirley Fitzgerald, the city’s official historian, told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s, **Sydney swept aside much of its past, including many of its finest buildings.** “Sydney is confused about itself,” she said. “We can’t seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one. It’s a conflict that we aren’t getting any better at resolving (解决).”

On the other hand, being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony. “Many people say that we lack culture in this country,” he told me. “What people forget is that the Italians, when they came to Australia, brought 2000 years of their culture, the Greeks some 3000 years, and the Chinese more still. We’ve got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country. It’s a pretty hard combination to beat.”

He is right, but I can’t help wishing they would keep those old ferries.

What is the first paragraph mainly about?

    C

A. Sydney’s striking architecture.  
B. The cultural diversity of Sydney.  
C. The key to Sydney’s development.  
D. Sydney’s tourist attractions in the 1960s.

    D

A. He goes to work by boat.  
B. He looks forward to a new life.  
C. He pilots catamarans well.  
D. He is attached to the old ferries.

What does Shirley Fitzgerald think of Sydney?

    A

A. It is losing its traditions.  
B. It should speed up its progress.

A. A city can be young and old at the same time.  
B. A city built on ancient cultures is more dynamic.  
C. Modernity is usually achieved at the cost of elegance.  
D. Compromise should be made between the local and the foreign.
