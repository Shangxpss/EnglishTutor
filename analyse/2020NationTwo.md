Theend of the school year was in sight and spirits were high. I was back teachingafter an absence of 15 years, dealing with the various kinds of “forbiddenfruit” that come out of book bags. Now was the spring of the water pistol.

Idecided to think up a method of dealing with forbidden fruit.

“Pleasebring that pistol to me,” I said. “I’m going to put it in my Grandma’s Box.”

“What’sthat?” they asked.

“It’sa large wooden chest full of toys for my grandchildren,” I replied,

“Youdon’t have grandchildren,” someone said.

“Idon’t now.” I replied. “But someday I will. When I do, my box will be full of wonderful
things for them.”

My imaginary Grandma’s Box worked like magic that spring, and later. Sometimes.students would ask me to describe all the things I had in it. Then I would try to remember the different possessions I supposedly had taken away—since I seldom actually kept them. Usually the offender would appear at the end of the day, and I would return the belonging.

The-yearswent by, and my first grandchild Gordon was born. I shared my joy with that year’sclass. Then someone said, “Now you can use your Grandma’s Box.” From then on instead of coming to ask their possessions back, the students would say, “That’sokay. Put it in your Grandma’s Box for Gordon.”

I loved talking about the imaginary box, not only with my students but also with my own children. They enjoyed hearing about all the forbidden fruit I had collected. Then one Christmas I received a surprise gift — a large, beautifullymade wooden chest. My son Bruce had made my Grandma’s Box a reality.

InMay 1987 the Golden Gate Bridge had a 50th birthday party. The bridge was closed to motor traffic so people could enjoy a walk across it. Organizers expected perhaps 50,000 people to show up. Instead, as many as 800, 000 crowded the roads to the bridge. By the time 250,000 were on the bridge, engineers noticed something terrible：the roadway was flattening under what turned out to be the heaviest load it had ever been asked to carry. Worse, it was beginning to sway（晃动）. The authorities closed access to the bridge and tens of thousands of people made their way back to land. A disaster was avoided.

The story is one of scores in To Forgive Design：Understanding Failure, a book that is at once a love letter to engineering and a paean（赞歌）to its breakdowns. Its author, Dr. Henry Petroski, has long been writing about disasters. In this book, he includes the loss of the spaceshuttles（航天飞机）Challenger and Columbia, and the sinking of the Titanic.

Though he acknowledges that engineering works can fail because the person who thought them up or engineered them simply got things wrong, in this book Dr. Petroski widens his view to consider the larger context in which such failures occur.Sometimes devices fail because a good design is constructed with low quality materials incompetently applied. Or perhaps a design works so well it is adopted else where again and again, with seemingly harmless improvements, until,suddenly, it does not work at all anymore.

Readers will encounter not only stories they have heard before, but some new stories and a moving discussion of the responsibility of the engineer to the public and the ways young engineers can be helped to grasp them.

“Success is success but that is all that it is,” Dr. Petroski writes. It is failure that brings improvement.

Rainforests are home to a rich variety of medicinal plants, food, birds and animals.
Can you believe that a single bush（灌木丛）in the Amazon may have more species of ants
than the whole of Britain! About 480 varieties of trees may be found in just onehectare of
rainforest.

Rainforests are the lungs of the planet-storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide
and producing a significant amount of the world’s oxygen. Rainforests have their
own perfect system for ensuring their own survival; the tall trees make a canopy（树冠层）
of branches and leaves which protect themselves, smaller plants,and the forest animals
from heavy rain, intense dry heat from the sun and strong winds.

Amazingly,the trees grow in such a way that their leaves and branches, although
close together, never actually touch those of another tree. Scientists think this is the plants’
way to prevent the spread of any tree diseases and make life more difficult for leaf-eating
insects like caterpillars. To survive in the forest,animals must climb, jump or fly across the
gaps. The ground floor of the forestis not all tangled leaves and bushes, like in films, but
is actually fairlyclear. It is where dead leaves turn into food for the trees and other
forestlife.

They are not called rainforests for nothing! Rainforests can generate 75%of theirown
rain. At least 80 inches of rain a year is normal-and in some areas theremay be as much
as 430 inches of rain annually. This is real rain-your umbrellamay protect you in a shower,
but it won’t keep you dry if there is a fullrainstorm. In just two hours, streams can rise ten to
twenty feet. The humidity（湿气）of large rainforests contributes to the formation of
raincloudsthat may travel to other countries in need of rain.

What can we learn about rainforests from the first paragraph?

    D

A. They produce oxygen.  
B. They cover a vast area.
C. They are well managed.  
D. They are rich in wildlife.

Which of the following contributes most to the survival of rainforests?

    B

A. Heavy rains
B. Big trees.
C. Small plants.
D. Forest animals.

Why do the leaves and branches of different trees avoid touching each other?

    C

A. For more sunlight.
B. For more growing space.
C. For self-protection.
D. For the detection of insects.

What can be a suitable title for the text?

    A

A. Life-Giving Rainforests
B. The Law of the Jungle
C. Animals in the Amazon
D. Weather in Rainforests
