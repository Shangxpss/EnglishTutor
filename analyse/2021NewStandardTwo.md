I have worked as a keeper at the National Zoo.paris for 11 years. Spot and Stripe are the first tiger cubs （幼兽）that have ever been born here. Globally， a third of Sumatran cubs in zoos don't make it to adulthood, so I decided to give them round-the-clock care at home.

I've got two children - the younger one, Kynan, was extremely happy about the tigers arriving - but all of us really looked forward to being part of their lives and watching them grow. I wasn't worried about bringing them into my home with my wife and kids. These were cubs. They weighed about 2.5 kg and were so small that there was absolutely no risk.

As they grew more mobile, we let them move freely around the house during the day, but when we were asleep we had to contain them in a large room, otherwise they'd get up to mischief. We'd come down in the morning to find they'd turned the room upside down, and left it looking like a zoo.

Things quickly got very intense due to the huge amount of energy required to look after them. There were some tough times and I just felt extremely tired. I was grateful that my family was there to help. We had to have a bit of a production line going, making up “tiger milk”, washing baby bottles, and cleaning the floors.

When Spot and Stripe were four months old, they were learning how to open doors and jump fences, and we knew it really was time for them to go. It was hard for us to finally part with them. For the first few days, Kynan was always a bit disappointed that the cubs weren't there.

I'm not sad about it. I'm hands-on with them every day at the zoo, and I do look back very fondly on the time that we had them.

A British woman who won a S1 million prize after she was named the World's Best Teacher will use the cash to bring inspirational figures into UK schools.

Andria Zafirakou,a north London secondary school teacher, said she wanted to bring about a classroom revolution（变革）. “We are going to make a change，＂she said.＂I＇ve started a project to promote the teaching of the arts in our schools."

The project results from the difficulties many schools have in getting artists of any sort - whether an up-and-coming local musician or a major movie star - into schools to work with and inspire children.

Zafirakou began the project at Alperton Community School, her place of work for the past twelve years. “I've seen those magic moments when children are talking to someone they are inspired by - their eyes are shining and their faces light up,” she said. “We need artists . more than ever in our schools."

Artist Michael Craig-Martin said: “Andria's brilliant project to bring artists from all fields into direct contact with children is particularly welcome at a time when the arts are being downgraded in schools." It was a mistake to see the arts as unnecessary, he added.

Historian Sir Simon Schama is also a supporter of the project. He said that arts education in schools was not just an add-on. “It is absolutely necessary. The future depends on creativity and creativity depends on the young. What will remain of us when artificial intelligence takes over will be our creativity, and it is our creative spirit, our visionary sense of freshness,that has been our strength for centuries."

28.What will Zafirakou do with her prize money?

    C

A.Make a movie.
B.Build new schools.
C.Run a project.
D.Help local musicians.

29.What does Craig-Martin think of the teaching of the arts in UK schools?

    D

A. It is particularly difficult.
B. It increases artists' income.
C. It opens children's mind.
D. It deserves greater attention.

30.What should be stressed in school education according to Schama?

    C

A.Moral principles.
B.Interpersonal skills.
C.Creative abilities.
D.Positive worldviews.

31.Which of the following is a suitable title for the text?

    A

A.Bring Artists to Schools
B.When Historians Meet Artists
C.Arts Education in Britain
D.The World's Best Arts Teacher

An Australian professor is developing a robot to monitor the health of grazing cattle, a development that could bring big changes to a profession that's relied largely on a low-tech approach for decades **but is facing a labor shortage.**

Salah Sukkarieh, a professor at the University of Sydney, sees robots as necessary given how cattlemen are aging. He is building a four-wheeled robot that will run on solar and electric power. **It will use cameras and sensors to monitor the animals.** A computer system will analyze the video to determine whether a cow is sick. Radio tags （标签）on the animals will measure temperature changes. **The quality of grassland will be tracked by monitoring the shape，color and texture （质地） of grass.** That way， cattlemen will know whether they need to move their cattle to another field for nutrition purposes.

Machines have largely taken over planting, watering and harvesting crops such as corn and wheat, but the monitoring of cattle has gone through fewer changes.

For Texas cattleman Pete Bonds, it's increasingly difficult to find workers interested in watching cattle. **But Bonds doesn't believe a robot is right for the job.** Years of experience in the industry - and failed attempts to use technology - **have convinced him that the best way to check cattle is with a man on a horse.** Bonds, who bought his first cattle almost 50 years ago, still has each of his cowboys inspect 300 or 400 cattle daily and look for signs that an animal is getting sick.

Other cattlemen see more promise in robots. Michael Kelsey Paris, **vice president of the Oklahoma Cattlemen's Association, said a robot could be extremely useful given rising concerns about cattle theft.** Cattle tend to be kept in remote places and their value has risen, making them appealing targets.

What is a problem with the cattle-raising industry?

    B

A.Soil pollution.
B.Lack of workers.
C.Aging machines.
D.Low profitability.

What will Sukkarieh's robot be able to do?

    A

A.Monitor the quality of grass.
B.Cure the diseased cattle.
C.Move cattle to another field.
D.Predict weather changes.

Why does Pete Bonds still hire cowboys to watch cattle?

    B

A.He wants to help them earn a living.
B.He thinks men can do the job better.
C.He is inexperienced in using robots.
D.He enjoys the traditional way of life.

How may robots help with cattle watching according to Michael Kelsey?

    D

A.Increase the value of cattle.
B.Bring down the cost of labor.
C.Make the job more appealing.
D.Keep cattle from being stolen.
