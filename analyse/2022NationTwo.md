In 1916, two girls of wealthy families, best friends from Auburn, N. Y. — Dorothy Woodruff and Rosamond Underwood — traveled to a settlement in the Rocky Mountains **to teach in a one-room schoolhouse.** The girls had gone to Smith College. They wore expensive clothes. So for them to move to Elkhead, Colo. to instruct the children whose shoes were held together with string was a surprise. Their stay in Elkhead is the subject of Nothing Daunted: The Unexpected Education of Two Society Girls in the West by Dorothy Wickenden, who is a magazine editor and Dorothy Woodruff’s granddaughter.

Why did they go then? Well, they wanted to do something useful. Soon, however, they realized what they had undertaken.

They moved in with a local family, the Harrisons, and, like them, had little privacy, rare baths, and a blanket of snow on their quilt when they woke up in the morning. Some mornings, Rosamond and Dorothy would arrive at the schoolhouse to find the children weeping from the cold. In spring, the snow was replaced by mud over ice.

In Wickenden’s book, she expanded on the history of the West and also on feminism, which of course influenced the girls’ decision to go to Elkhead. A hair-raising section concerns the building of the railroads, which entailed (牵涉) drilling through the Rockies, often in blinding snowstorms. The book ends with Rosamond and Dorothy’s return to Auburn.

Wickenden is a very good storyteller. The sweep of the land and the stoicism (坚忍) of the people move her to some beautiful writing. Here is a picture of Dorothy Woodruff, on her horse, looking down from a hill top: “When the sun slipped behind the mountains, it shed a rosy glow all around them. Then a full moon rose. The snow was marked only by small animals: foxes, coyotes, mice, and varying hares, which turned white in the winter.”

Can a small group of drones (无人机) guarantee the safety and reliability of railways and, at the same time, help railway operators save billions of euros each year? That is the very likely future of applying today’s “eyes in the sky” technology to making sure that the millions of kilometres of rail tracks and infrastructure (基础设施) worldwide are safe for trains on a 24/7 basis.

Drones are already being used to examine high-tension electrical lines. They could do precisely the same thing to inspect railway lines and other vital aspects of rail infrastructure such as the correct position of railway tracks and switching points. The more regularly they can be inspected, the more railway safety, reliability and on-time performance will be improved. Costs would be cut and operations would be more efficient (高效) across the board.

That includes huge savings in maintenance costs and better protection of railway personnel safety. It is calculated that European railways alone spend approximately 20 billion euros a year on maintenance, including sending maintenance staff, often at night, to inspect and repair the rail infrastructure. That can be dangerous work that could be avoided with drones assisting the crews’ efforts.

By using the latest technologies, drones could also start providing higher-value services for railways, detecting faults in the rail or switches, before they can cause any safety problems. To perform these tasks, drones for rail don’t need to be flying overhead. Engineers are now working on a new concept: the rail drones of the future. They will be moving on the track ahead of the train, and programmed to run autonomously. Very small drones with advanced sensors and AI and travelling ahead of the train could guide it like a co-pilot. With their ability to see ahead, they could signal any problem, so that fast-moving trains would be able to react in time.

The Government’s sugar tax on soft drinks has brought in half as much money as Ministers first predicted it would generate, the first official data on the policy has shown.

First announced in April, 2016, the tax which applies to soft drinks containing more than 5g of sugar per 100ml, was introduced **to help reduce childhood obesity (肥胖)**. It is believed that today’s children and teenagers are consuming three times the recommended level of sugar, putting them at a higher risk of the disease.

Initially the sugar tax was expected to make £520m a year for the Treasury. However, data of the first six months showed it would make less than half this amount. At present it is expected to generate £240m for the year ending in April 2019, which will go to school sports.

It comes after more than **half of soft drinks sold in shops have had their sugar levels cut by manufacturers (制造商)** so they can avoid paying the tax. Drinks now contain 45 million fewer kilos of sugar as a result of manufacturers’ efforts to avoid the charge, according to Treasury figures. Since April drinks companies have been forced to pay between 18p and 24p for every litre of sugary drink they produce or import, depending on the sugar content.

However, some high sugar brands, like Classic Coca Cola, have accepted the sugar tax and are refusing to change for fear of upsetting consumers. Fruit juices, milk-based drinks and most alcoholic drinks are free of the tax, as are small companies manufacturing fewer than 1m litres per year.

Today’s figures, according to one government official, show the positive influence the sugar tax is having by raising billions of pounds for sports facilities (设施) and healthier eating in schools. Helping the next generation to have a healthy and active childhood is of great importance, and the industry is playing its part.

Why was the sugar tax introduced?

    C

A. To collect money for schools.  
B. To improve the quality of drinks.  
C. To protect children’s health.  
D. To encourage research in education.

How did some drinks companies respond to the sugar tax?

    D

A. They turned to overseas markets.  
B. They raised the prices of their products.  
C. They cut down on their production.  
D. They reduced their products’ sugar content.

From which of the following is the sugar tax collected?

    D

A. Most alcoholic drinks.  
B. Milk-based drinks.  
C. Fruit juices.  
D. Classic Coke.

What can be inferred about the adoption of the sugar tax policy?

    B

A. It is a short-sighted decision.  
B. It is a success story.  
C. It benefits manufacturers.  
D. It upsets customers.

Young children across the globe enjoy playing games of hide and seek. For them, there’s something highly exciting about 21C someone else’s glance and making oneself unable to be seen.

However, we all witness that preschool children are remarkably 22B at hiding. They often cover only their eyes with their hands, leaving the rest of their bodies 23A .

For a long time, this ineffective hiding method was 24D as evidence that children are hopelessly “egocentric” (自我中心的) creatures. But our 25C research results in child developmental psychology 26C that idea.

We brought young children aged 2-4 into our Minds in Development Lab at USC. Each 27B sat down with an adult who covered her own eyes or 28D . We then asked the child if she could 29A or hear the adult. Surprisingly, children replied that they couldn’t. The same 30B happened when the adult covered her own mouth: 31B children said that they couldn’t 32A to her.

A number of 33C ruled out that the children misunderstood what they were being asked. The results were clear: Our young subjects 34A the questions and knew 35D what was asked of them. Their 36A to the questions reflected their true 37B that “I can see you only if you can see me, too.” They simply 38C mutual (相互的) recognition and regard. Our 39D suggest when a child “hides” by putting a blanket over her head, it is not a result of egocentrism. In fact, children consider this method 40D when others
use it.
