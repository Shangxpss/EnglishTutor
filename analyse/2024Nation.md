Animals can express their needs using a lot of ways. For instance, almost all animals have distinct vocals (声 音) that they rely on to either ask for help, scare away any dangerous animals or look for shelter. But cats are special creatures who possess amazing vocalization skills. They are able to have entire conversations with humans using meows and you're able to interpret it. If a pet cat is hungry, it will keep meowing to attract attention and find food. However, when a cat is looking for affection, they tend to produce stretched and soft meows. Meowing starts as soon as a baby cat is brought to life and uses it to get the mother's attention and be fed.

Cats have many heightened senses, but their sense of smell is quite impressive. They use their noses to assess their environment and look out for any signs of danger. They will sniff out specific areas before they choose a place to relax. **However, another way the cats are able to distinguish between situations is by looking for familiar smells.** Your cat will likely smell your face and store the smell in its memory and use it to recognize you in the future. That's why most pet cats are able to tell immediately if their owners were around any other cats, which they don't usually like.

Dogs are known for their impressive fetching habit, but cats take this behavior up a notch. Many cats will find random objects outside and bring them to their owners. This is a very old habit that's been present in all kinds of predators (食肉动物). Cats bring gifts for their owners to show they love you. These adorable little hunters are just doing something that it's been in their nature since the beginning of time. So just go along with it!

**The Saint Lukas train doesn’t accept passengers — it accepts only the sick.** The Saint Lukas is one of five government-sponsored medical trains that travel to remote towns in central and eastern Russia. Each stop lasts an average of two days, and during that time the doctors and nurses on board provide rural (乡村) populations with basic medical care, X-ray scans and prescriptions.

“People started queuing to make an appointment early in the morning,” says Emile Ducke, a German photographer who traveled with the staff of the Saint Lukas for a two-week trip in November through the vast regions (区域) of Krasnoyarsk and Khakassia.

**Russia’s public health care service has been in serious need of modernization.** The government has struggled to come up with measures to address the problem, particularly in the poorer, rural areas east of the Volga River, including arranging doctor’s appointments by video chat and expanding financial aid programs to motivate doctors to practice medicine in remote parts of the country **like Krasnoyarsk**.

The annual arrival of the Saint Lukas is another attempt to improve the situation. **For 10 months every year, the train stops at about eight stations over two weeks, before returning to the regional capital to refuel and restock (补给).** Then it starts all over again the next month. Most stations wait about a year between visits.

Doctors see up to 150 patients every day. The train’s equipment allows for basic checkups. **“I was very impressed by the doctors and their assistants working and living in such little space but still staying focused and very concerned,”** says Ducke. **“They were the best chance for many rural people to get the treatment they want. ”**

**“I didn’t like the ending,” I said to my favorite college professor.** It was my junior year of undergraduate, and I was doing an independent study on Victorian literature. **I had just finished reading The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot, and I was heartbroken with the ending. Prof. Gracie, with all his patience, asked me to think about it beyond whether I liked it or not.** He suggested I think about the difference between endings that I wanted for the characters and endings that were right for the characters, endings that satisfied the story even if they didn’t have a traditionally positive outcome. Of course, I would have preferred a different ending for Tom and Maggie Tulliver, but the ending they got did make the most sense for them.

**This was an aha moment for me, and I never thought about endings the same way again. From then on, if I wanted to read an ending guaranteed to be happy, I’d pick up a love romance. If I wanted an ending I couldn’t guess, I’d pick up a mystery (悬疑小说). One where I kind of knew what was going to happen, historical fiction. Choosing what to read became easier.**

But writing the end — that’s hard. It’s hard for writers because endings carry so much weight with readers. You have to balance creating an ending that's unpredictable, but doesn’t seem to come from nowhere, one that fits what’s right for the characters.

That’s why this issue ( 期) of Writer’s Digest aims to help you figure out how to write the best ending for whatever kind of writing you’re doing. If it’s short stories, Peter Mountford breaks down six techniques you can try to see which one helps you stick the landing. Elizabeth Sims analyzes the final chapters of five great novels to see what key points they include and how you can adapt them for your work.

This issue won’t tell you what your ending should be — that’s up to you and the story you’re telling — but it might provide what you need to get there.

One day, we had a family dinner. While the adults were busy with their serious talk outside, I was left alone in the 21B to help my grandmother wash dishes. 22A my grandmother would tell me stories about her childhood.

Born just before WWII, my grandmother 23D an entirely different childhood lifestyle from mine. She did not have a chance to go to 24B . Like in typical families, where boys were 25A much more than girls, my grandma had to stay at home to do 26D . The only opportunity (机会) she could seize to 27B was when her brother was having Chinese 28C with the family tutor. She would sit quietly at the far end of the long dinner table, listening 29A. This training taught her to read and write her Chinese upside down — a skill that has turned out to be quite 30D , especially whenever we share the newspaper. On most weekends, my grandmother, a young girl then, and her brother would go to the 31C . There, they would walk through deep water, sit down cross-legged underwater and hold their 32B while they watched all action going on around them. This is something I 33A — her ability to open her 34C underwater and still sit comfortably on the seabed.
