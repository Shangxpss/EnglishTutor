When John Todd was a child, he loved to explore the woods around his house, observing how nature solved problems. A dirty stream, for example, often became clear after flowing through plants and along rocks where tiny creatures lived. When he got older, John started to wonder if this process could be used to clean up the messes people were making.

After studying agriculture, medicine, and fisheries in college, **John went back to observing nature and asking questions.** Why can certain plants trap harmful bacteria (细菌)? Which kinds of fish can eat cancer-causing chemicals? With the right combination of animals and plants, he figured, maybe he could clean up waste the way nature did. He decided to build what he would later call an eco-machine.

The task John set for himself was to remove harmful substances from some sludge (污泥). First, he constructed a series of clear fiberglass tanks connected to each other. Then he went around to local ponds and streams and brought back some plants and animals. He placed them in the tanks and waited. Little by little, these different kinds of life got used to one another and formed their own ecosystem. After a few weeks, John added the sludge.

He was amazed at the results. The plants and animals in the eco-machine took the sludge as food and began to eat it! Within weeks, it had all been digested, and all that was left was pure water.

Over the years, John has taken on many big jobs. He developed a greenhouse — like facility that treated sewage (污水) from 1,600 homes in South Burlington. He also designed an eco-machine to clean canal water in Fuzhou, a city in southeast China.

“Ecological design” is the name John gives to what he does. “Life on Earth is kind of a box of spare parts for the inventor,” he says. “You put organisms in new relationships and observe what’s happening. **Then you let these new systems develop their own ways to self-repair.”**

The goal of this book is to make the case for digital minimalism, including a detailed exploration of what it asks and why it works, and then to teach you how to adopt this philosophy if you decide it’s right for you.

To do so, I divided the book into two parts. In part one, I describe the philosophical foundations of digital minimalism, starting with an examination of the forces that are making so many people’s digital lives increasingly intolerable, before moving on to a detailed discussion of the digital minimalism philosophy.

Part one concludes by introducing my suggested method for adopting this philosophy: the digital declutter. This process requires you to step away from optional online activities for thirty days. At the end of the thirty days, you will then add back a small number of carefully chosen online activities that you believe will provide massive benefits to the things you value.

**In the final chapter of part one, I’ll guide you through carrying out your own digital declutter.** In doing so, I’ll draw on an experiment I ran in 2018 in which over 1,600 people agreed to perform a digital declutter. You’ll hear these participants’ stories and learn what strategies worked well for them, and what traps they encountered that you
should avoid.

The second part of this book takes a closer look at some ideas that will help you cultivate (培养) a sustainable digital minimalism lifestyle. In these chapters, I examine issues such as the importance of solitude (独处) and the necessity of cultivating high-quality leisure to replace the time most now spend on mindless device use. Each chapter
concludes with a collection of practices, which are designed to help you act on the big ideas of the chapter. **You can view these practices as a toolbox meant to aid your efforts to build a minimalist lifestyle that works for your particular circumstances.**

What is the book aimed at?

    B.

A. Teaching critical thinking skills.  
B. Advocating a simple digital lifestyle.  
C. Solving philosophical problems.  
D. Promoting the use of a digital device.

What does the underlined word “declutter” in paragraph 3 mean?

    A

A. Clear-up.  
B. Add-on.  
C. Check-in.  
D. Take-over.

What is presented in the final chapter of part one?

    carry out your own digital declutter, carry out = to perform or complete a job = practice

A. Theoretical models.  
B. Statistical methods.  
C. Practical examples.  
D. Historical analyses.

What does the author suggest readers do with the practices offered in part two?

    A toolbox meaning use as need

A. Use them as needed.  
B. Recommend them to friends.  
C. Evaluate their effects.  
D. Identify the ideas behind them.

On March 7, 1907, the English statistician Francis Galton published a paper which illustrated what has come to be known as the “wisdom of crowds” effect. The experiment of estimation he conducted showed that in some cases, the average of a large number of independent estimates could be quite accurate.

**This effect capitalizes on the fact that when people make errors, those errors aren’t always the same.** Some people will tend to overestimate, and some to underestimate. When enough of these errors are averaged together, they cancel each other out, resulting in a more accurate estimate. If people are similar and tend to make the same
errors, then their errors won’t cancel each other out. In more technical terms, the wisdom of crowds requires that people’s estimates be independent. If for whatever reasons, people’s errors become correlated or dependent, the accuracy of the estimate will go down.

**But a new study led by Joaquin Navajas offered an interesting twist (转折) on this classic phenomenon.** The key finding of the study was that when crowds were further divided into smaller groups that were allowed to have a discussion, the averages from these groups were more accurate than those from an equal number of independent individuals. For instance, the average obtained from the estimates of four discussion groups of five was significantly more accurate than the average obtained from 20 independent individuals.

**In a follow-up study with 100 university students, the researchers tried to get a better sense of what the group members actually did in their discussion.** Did they tend to go with those most confident about their estimates? Did they follow those least willing to change their minds? This happened some of the time, but it wasn’t the dominant response. Most frequently, the groups reported that they “shared arguments and reasoned together”. Somehow, these arguments and reasoning resulted in a global reduction in error. **Although the studies led by Navajas have limitations and many questions remain, the potential implications for group discussion and decision-making are enormous.**

On Oct. 11, hundreds of runners competed in a cross-country race in Minnesota. Melanie Bailey should have
, 41D the course earlier than she did. Her 42A came because she was carrying a 43D across
the finish line.

As reported by a local newspaper, Bailey was more than two-thirds of the way through her 44A when a
runner in front of her began crying in pain. She 45C to help her fellow runner, Danielle Lenoue. Bailey took
her arm to see if she could walk forward with 46B . She couldn’t. Bailey then 47D to let Lenoue
climb onto her back and carried her all the way to the finish line, then another 300 feet to where Lenoue could get
48A attention.

Once there, Lenoue was 49B and later taken to a hospital, where she learned that she had serious injuries
in one of her knees. She would have struggled with extreme 50B to make it to that aid checkpoint without
Bailey’s help.

As for Bailey, she is more 51C about why her act is considered a big 52D . “She was just crying.
I couldn’t 53A her,” Bailey told the reporter. “I feel like I was just doing the right thing.”

Although the two young women were strangers before the 54C , they’ve since become friends. Neither
won the race, but the 55B of human kindness won the day.
