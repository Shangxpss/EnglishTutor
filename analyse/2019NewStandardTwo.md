It’s about 250 miles from the hills of west-central lowa to Ehlers’ home in Minnesota. During the long trip home, following a weekend of hunting. Ehlers 41C about the small dog he had seen 42B alongside the road. He had 43A to coax(哄)the dog to him but, frightened, it had 44D .

Back home, Ehlers was troubled by that 45C dog. So, four days later, he called his friend Greg, and the
two drove 46C . After a long and careful 47D . Greg saw, across a field, the dog moving 48D away. Ehlers eventually succeeded in coaxing the animal to him. Nervousness and fear were replaced with 49B . It just started licking(舔)Ehlers’ face.

A local farmer told them the dog sounded like one 50B as lost in the local paper. The ad had a 51 number for a town in southern Michigan. Ehlers 52A the number of Jeff and Lisa to tell them he had 53C their dog.

Jeff had 54C in lowa before Thanksgiving with his dog, Rosie, but the gun shots had scared the dog off. Jeff searched 55B for Rosie in the next four days.

Ehlers returned to Minnesotan, and then drove 100 miles to Minneapolis to put Rosie on a flight to Michigan. “It’s good to know there’s still someone out there who 56A enough to go to that kind of 57D ,”says Lisa of Ehlers’ rescue 58C .

I figured whoever lost the dog was probably just as 59C to it as I am to my dogs,” says Ehlers. “If it had been my dog, I’d hope that somebody would be 60D to go that extra mile.”
